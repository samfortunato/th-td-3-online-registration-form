# Online Registration Form

## Techdegree Project 2

This is the GitHub repository for the third project for the Front End Web Development Techdegree at Treehouse.

### Info

The project was an assignment to build an online newsletter registration form based off of a provided image mock-up. A mobile version and a desktop version were required.

The form markup and general HTML markup were created using proper HTML5 practices. The HTML markup was written to be semantic and descriptive, down to the IDs and class names.

Proper form tags and input types were used for the various form elements, such as fieldsets for organizing groups of related inputs, and different input types used for processing specific pieces of data (such as telephone numbers).

Visual stylings were based off of the mockup given, with some personal touch-ups added by myself to taste. A custom font from Google Fonts was utilized.

Both the HTML and CSS are valid, according to the W3C validator services.
